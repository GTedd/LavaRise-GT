# LavaRise - Minecraft Spigot Plugin

**LavaRise** is an exciting Minecraft minigame plugin where players must survive in a world that is slowly filling with lava. Players must outlast each other as the lava rises, using strategy, items, and sometimes PvP combat, depending on the configuration.

## Features:

- **Fully Customizable Configurations**: 
  - Define the game arena, lobby location, player limits, PvP settings, and the maximum lava level. You have full control over all game mechanics through the configuration.
  
- **Multi-Arena Support**: 
  - Create multiple arenas with different settings and configurations.

- **Scoreboard Integration**: 
  - Display the current game status, lava level, and player information directly on a scoreboard during the game.

- **Spectator Mode**: 
  - When players are eliminated, they can spectate the ongoing game.
